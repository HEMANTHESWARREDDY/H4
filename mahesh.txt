
				 A FAN OF MAHESHBABU
                                THE PEPOLE AROUND ME MADE TO BE IT
by birth i am not a fan of maheshbabu.
the environment around me in my childhood made me a fan of him.
evrey relative when ever i meet them they compare me with him.
This thing made me curious about who is he.
in that process of knowing him i am just habituated to his manarisum after seeing his all movies 
and mainly some of his interviews thought me how to behave and avoid contraversys.
The childhood period of me is one of the peak stage of his carrer so that mahesh fans has spearate power in there hands when ever a fan war raise.
(this is also one of the reason of to be a fan of him at that time ).
when ever i run every one says ur running like him 
yeah ofcoure i never practiced to do it.
but actually his running style strucked some where in my curly hair.
Because the first thing what i remember when they say about running is his running style which cannot replaced by others.
Just because of his running style the boring chasing scences became intence scenes for me.
Usually i like thumbsup in my childhood.
But after knowing that mahesh is the brand ambsidor of it.I even liked it more.
the first facebook account that i created was on his name and with his profile picture.
